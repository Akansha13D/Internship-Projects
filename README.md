These projects are part of my Internship Program I recently completed. 
During the internship I learnt Python for Data Analysis, including various Python Libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn.
I got to experience hands on approach on reading data files in pandas, cleaning data, dealing with missing values, performing exploratory data analysis, plotting various charts, and showcasing insights using Tableau for visualisation and creating dashboards.

PROJECTS-
1) Google Play Store Apps Exploratory Data Analysis -
Objective:
The goal of this project is to analyze the characteristics of apps on the Google Play Store, including their ratings, reviews, sizes, installation counts, and more. The analysis will help identify trends, outliers, and patterns in the app market.

2) Coffee Sales Analysis-
 This dataset contains detailed records of coffee sales from a vending machine.
The vending machine is the work of a dataset author who is committed to providing an open dataset to the
community.
It is intended for analysis of purchasing patterns, sales trends, and customer preferences related to coffee products.
I have used Tableau Dashboard to showcase various analysis.
The datasets are available on Kaggle.
